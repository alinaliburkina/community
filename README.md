## Values

- Technical Excellence
- Knowledge Sharing
- Continuous Improvement



## Community

This is a place for software engineers who care about software quality. You are motivated by clean code - it's not enough to make something work, you want to implement it well. You set high expectations for yourself and your team. 

> "There is no trade-off of quality vs. speed in software... Low quality means low speed... The only way to go fast is to go well." - Uncle Bob

You understand that the underlying problem faced by the software industry is the misunderstanding between speed and quality. For you, it's crystal-clear that you can't be fast without quality. Quality and speed go hand-in-hand. You push for quality even when you're in the minority. You find yourself in environments where no one seems to understand this. Companies are facing the same vicious cycle. Low quality, not enough time, requiring superstars to put out fires.

You want to make an impact in spreading technical excellence. You see technical excellence as a core foundation of your work, not a nice-to-have. You want to exchange knowledge with people who care about quality, people who enjoy learning, reading books, researching, continious improvement.

There aren't many people like you. People like you are dispersed across the world, trying their best to make a change, but the impact is localized to their immediate teams, or to their companies, or perhaps through meetups.

This is a global community aiming to bring together professional software engineers who have invested in their own personal growth, who are aiming to achieve mastery, poeple who never stop learning, people who enjoy mentoring and coaching, spreading knowledge. People for whom software engineering is more than just a 9-5 job.

## Collective Knowledge

The "inputs" are our discussions, knowledgesharing, collective knowledge: [Discussions](https://github.com/valentinacupac/community/discussions).

The "outputs" are a synthesis of knowledge, both conceptual (theory and abstractions) and practical (implementation through code samples). Current code samples are [Banking Kata in Java](https://github.com/valentinacupac/banking-kata-java) and [Banking Kata in .NET](https://github.com/valentinacupac/banking-kata-dotnet). Feel free to update this seciton with links to other GitHub samples.

This community is the first step towards bringing technical excellence back as the foundation.
